### For grading, see code/cs230/ for code that 1) downloads images and 2) runs downstream tasks from baseline features.

## Directories:
- code/: contains relevant code for the project
- code/analysis/: contains code that runs through the MOSAIKS pipeline in order
- code/mosaiks/: the "MOSAIKS" library, contains utility R and python files that implement MOSAIKS and data processing
- code/cs230/: Our code and working directory for this project. !!! LOOK HERE FOR GRADING !!!
- data/: NOT INCLUDED, but exists on our EC2 instance. This contains all generated intermediate data, all raw data, including images.

The rest of the code is pulled and modified slightly from the MOSAIKS codebase.
